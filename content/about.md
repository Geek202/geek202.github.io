Here's a few things you might want to know about me:
- My name's Tom
- I go by the pronouns `they/them`, but I won't be annoyed if you call me he/she :)
- I'm a student and developer from the UK.
- `This` is a colour that I find quite nice
- I like write `code`...
- ...and my favourite programming languages to write are `Kotlin` and `Java`.
- I've also enjoyed writing a few things in `Rust`, but I'm still learning
-  I find `JavaScipt` annoying, and so prefer `TypeScript`.
- This website is built with [Zola](https://getzola.org), using `HTML`, `Markdown` and a pinch of `CSS`
- You can find me on a few different places, including [<i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Discord](https://discord.gg/tCAWpDsBmh), [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub](https://github.com/Geek202), [<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCnY3mByJrN6ZbUC7PAAeySw/) and [<i class="fab fa-twitch"></i> Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tom_the_geek)
- Many of my projects are `Minecraft mods` (check them out on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/tom_the_geek/projects) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Geek202) ðŸ˜‰), but I've also messed with
  - [Discord bots](https://top.gg/bot/637593441194344470)
  - React.js and [Vue.js](https://github.com/Geek202/CardGameClient)
  - [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Geek202/thread)
- I also think Twemoji is pretty cool, which is why I used them for all the emoji on this website ðŸ™ƒ
