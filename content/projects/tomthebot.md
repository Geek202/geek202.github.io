Tom_The_Bot was a Discord bot that I made for a personal Discord server, but
then decided to release publicly. The original version is written in Java using
JDA, but I'm working on a re-write in Kotlin using the
[Kord-Extensions](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions) library as
a framework. The bot features lots of commands, including a moderation system
(rewritten in the V3 re-write), customisable join+leave messages an a custom
permissions system.
