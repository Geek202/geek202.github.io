TomsServerUtils was a mod I worked on for a small survival server I setup for me and my friends, its original purpose being to relay ingame chat to
a channel in our Discord and chat from Discord into the game. I then expanded the mod with features such as a homes system and a crash reporter.
I now add new features when I need them, and so the mod is expands whenever I would like something new.
